## About
>This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
>the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
>types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
>optimized data sorting.

[Subject Push_swap Project 42](Push_swap.pdf)

## Setup
### Mandatory part

```
git clone https://github.com/J0hann3/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make
```
Then run `./push_swap` followed by the numbers to sort.

```
./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
```
The progam will print the operation needed to sort the list of integers.

### Bonus part

```
git clone https://github.com/J0hann3/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make bonus
```
Then run `./checker` followed by the numbers to sort. The program will wait instructions in the standart input to check if the instructions sort correclty the two stacks.
