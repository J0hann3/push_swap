## About
>This project will make you sort data on a stack, with a limited set of instructions, using
>the lowest possible number of actions. To succeed youâ€™ll have to manipulate various
>types of algorithms and choose the most appropriate solution (out of many) for an
>optimized data sorting.

[Subject Push_swap Project 42](Push_swap.pdf)

The `push_swap` program sorts a list of integers using only two stacks and a limited set of instructions.

## Features
- **Description**: Sort a list of integers in the most efficient way possible.
- **Feature**: Write the instructions used to sort the list of integers, try to minimize them
- **How to Use**: Run the program, followed by the list of integers to sort

## Setup
### Mandatory part

**Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/J0hann3/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make
```

### Bonus part

**Clone the Repository**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/J0hann3/push_swap.git
cd push_swap
make bonus
```

## Usage
### Mandatory part

- Run `./push_swap` followed by a list of integers to sort:
```bash
./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8
```
- The program will output the sequence of operations needed to sort the list of integers.
- Possible Operations:
  - `sa` => Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack a.
  - `sb` => Swap the first 2 elements at the top of stack b.
  - `ss` => `sa` and `sb` at the same time.
  - `pa` => Take the first element at the top of b and put it at the top of a.
  - `pb` => Take the first element at the top of a and put it at the top of b.
  - `ra` => Shift up all elements of stack a by 1.
  - `rb` => Shift up all elements of stack b by 1.
  - `rr` => ra and rb at the same time.
  - `rra` => Shift down all elements of stack a by 1.
  - `rrb` => Shift down all elements of stack b by 1.
  - `rrr` => rra and rrb at the same time.

### Bonus part
- Run `./checker` followed  by the list of integers to sort. The program will then wait for instructions in standard input to verify if the sorting instructions are correct:
```bash
./checker 2 1 3 6 5 8
sa
ra
rb
pa
ss
rra
```
- Print `OK\n` if the instructions correctly sort the numbers, otherwise it will print `KO\n`.

## New Notion

### Sorting algorithms

For this project, understanding the following sorting algorithms will help optimize the number of operations used:

- Merge sort
- Selection sort
- Quick sort
- Insertion sort
- Bubble sort
